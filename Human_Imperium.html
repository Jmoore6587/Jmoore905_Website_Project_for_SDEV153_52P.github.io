    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Warhammer 40k</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">A Quick Primer for the Casually Interested</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Humans and the Imperium of Man.</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">Humans in Warhammer 40k are spread all across the galaxy, as untold trillions of people work to keep the constant war machine running. Imagine that every military organization on planet Earth was all part of one army working under the banner of keeping humans alive.  </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">Now replicate this military model across countless human worlds, add in conscriptions in the form of “Foundings” when more troops are needed, and then you will have the most basic of the human army, known specifically as The Imperial Guard. An untold mass of soldiers that move as a wave across the battlefield, where every average Joe can be a hero as long as he survives.  </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">As a sci-fi setting, the idea of robots and cyborgs is not unheard of in Warhammer 40k, but the emphasis is more on cyborgs than robots. This is because in the past, the Imperium fought a war against their own mechanical creations, and as a means to try and avoid their previous errors, they use the human brain as a limiter. The human brain is the primary computer that is used to run these cyborgs, as well as a variety of other mechanical means that make up the Adeptus Mechanicus. The Adeptus Mechanics are the ones responsible for making everything that any trooper uses. Every weapon, vehicle, and accessory that is made of metal and used by any type of soldier is built upon a Forge World: That’s an entire planet that has been turned into a giant factory.  </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">Now, if they swap out the cyborgs for genetic mutations, then you get the Space Marines. These are the most powerful weapons in the human arsenal. Super advances soldiers that are twice the size of the average man and can move faster and hit harder than any human ever should. Equip them with the best weapons and armor that the Mechanicus can build for them, and you have an unstoppable army the likes of which our current-day military could only dream of. </p>
