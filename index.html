    <h2 style="text-align: center;">A Quick Primer for the Casually Interested</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">The realm of Warhammer 40k is a vast one that holds a wide array of possibilities. This is what often draws many people to the universe of the 41st millennium, but the size and scope of the said universe is just that: an entire universe that is filled with a variety of inhabitants. It is my feeling that the best way to understand and appreciate this universe is to do so through the specific races that inhabit its wide-ranging space. It’s through learning about the differing cultures of each race that really brought home how wide-ranging and accessible this particular universe can be. 
 So consider this a fan’s take on the easiest way to break into a new hobby, or even just take a glance at what’s out there…besides war. There is a lot of war, and it never stops.
